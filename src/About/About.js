          <strong>Welcome to my website.</strong><br /><br />
          My name is James Rex Miller IV.
          <br /><br /> Typically I go by Jim (sometimes JimJames), but feel free to call
          me whatever you like.
          <br /><br />I am a Front End engineer who 
          has worn many hats. 
          <br /><br />No, seriously.
          <br /><br /> Like at least 3 hats.ðŸŽ“ðŸ§¢ðŸŽ©

          <strong>In addition to working in many industries,<br /> I have lived in many places.</strong> <br/><br/>Originally, I was born in 
          Chicago, IL. But since then I have lived in the Bay Area, Indiana, Los Angeles, Tucson, and Denver. 
          <br /><br />
          While in Tuscon, I attended the University
          of Arizona and got a Bachelor's Degree in Communications, with a minor in Business Administration.

          <br /><br />Beardown!

          <strong>I have lived an unconventional life, and that is why I remain so curious.</strong> <br /><br />There is no greater sense of excitement and hope when 
          you embark on a new adventure.
          <br /><br />
          That's why in August of 2019, I decided to enroll at the Turing School of Software and Design to learn software engineering.
          <br /><br />
          Easily one of the best decisions I have made in my life, because it opened a world of possibilities for me. <br /><br />With a never ending amount of 
          new technologies and paradigms to learn and master, my propensity for diving into rabbit holes and learning ALL THE THINGS will forever remain a work
          in progress (kinda like this website).
