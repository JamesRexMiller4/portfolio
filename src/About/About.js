          Hello! Welcome to my personal website. My name is James Rex Miller IV, 
          but typically I go by Jim, sometimes JimJames. I am a Front End engineer who 
          has worn many hats. Prior to software development I worked in sales in a myriad 
          of industries: financial services, logistics, hospitality, event planning. I even did a stint 
          as a substitute teacher. 
        </p>

          In addition to working in many industries, I have lived in many places. Originally, I was born in 
          Chicago, IL. But then I lived in a lot of different parts of Indiana, before moving back to Chicago at 
          the beginning of fourth grade where I would remain for the rest of grade school. 
          
          Then I hopped over to the Bay Area for high school, before heading off to Tuscon, Arizona to attend the University
          of Arizona where I got my Bachelor's Degree in Communications, with a minor in Business Administration. Since college, 
          I have moved back to Chicago, moved to Los Angeles, and moved to Denver, Colorado where I currently reside. 
        </p>

          I have lived an unconventional life, and I think that is why I remain so curious. There is no greater sense of excitement and hope when 
          you embark on a new adventure. For most of professional life I have been searching for the place that felt like home. While the sales 
          career gave me gifts in articulation and development in professionalism, it left me craving something more. 

          That's why in August of 2019 I decided to make the career switch into software development by enrolling in to the FrontEnd engineering 
          program at the Turing School of Software and Design. For the next 7 months I learned about the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, 
          Test Driven Development, UI/UX Design, and the moral intersections we as a society find ourselves as we integrate technology more and more into
          our daily lives.

          Enrolling into Turing was the best decision I have made in my life, because it opened a world of possibilities for me. With a never ending amount of 
          new technologies and paradigms to learn and master, my propensity for diving into rabbit holes and learning ALL THE THINGS will forever remain a work
          work in progess (kinda like this website).
